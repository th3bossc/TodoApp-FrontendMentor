## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [AngularJs](https://angular.io/) - JS Framework
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) - For drag and drop functionality
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor


### What I learned

I learnt to work with drag and drop API in Javascript, and how to use prewritten APIs and components from Angular Material throughout this project


### Useful resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/) - Angular is one of the best JavaScript frameworks available and it makes writing frontend code much easier than vanilla Javascript
- [Angular Material Drag and Drop API](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview) - Drag and drop API provided by Angular Material has additional functionality such as easier binding with javascript elements such as arrays to keep track of change, as well as documentation on how to create smooth animations that work well with the dragging function.
